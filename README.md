# AzureBackend

The Azure backend uses an MVC approach to implement an Object-Relation Mapping system so that Browsers and Android Apps can access SQL Servers without running SQL.


Everytime you change the schema, you need to update the fields of the DataObjects in the Azure Server Code.
To add a new Controller for a DataObject, you need to right click the Controller and add a New Mobile Azure Table Controller.
